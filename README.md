# Cobra keyboard

These are KiCad files for a keyboard for the [Cobra
computer](http://cobrasov.com).  It is adapted from the [version 1.0 keyboard
on cobrasov.com](http://cobrasov.com/CoBra%20Project/kbd1.0.html).

The changes were necessary to adapt the design to the orientation and sizes of
my [custom keycaps](https://github.com/tsowell/cobra-keycaps).

NOTE: This revision has not been tested yet.  After I ordered the PCB for the
[previous revision][b5ad87d], I decided to swap the locations of the GRAPH and
NEW MODE keys.
